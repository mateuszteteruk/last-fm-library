# Last.fm Library

## Archived
Why? Last.fm is really unstable and doesn't fulfill my needs.

## What does this repo contain?

You can find here Android app which main goal is to fetch data from Last.fm API and visualize them in pretty way.
This is also playground and showcase of using some latest libraries from Android world, including (random order):
- Gradle Kotlin
- Dagger
- Jetpack Compose -> coming soon
- Multi-module architecture
- Coroutines
- and a lot of 'default' ones, like Room, Retrofit etc.


## How to build
You have to get your own [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm) API key.
Add it to `local.properties` file like this:
```
lastfm_api_key=YOUR_LASTFM_API_KEY
```
